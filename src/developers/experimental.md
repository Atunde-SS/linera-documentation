# Experimental Topics

In this section, we present some experimental features of the Linera protocol.

Experimental features are generally not available on the Linera testnet. You may
have to compile Linera from sources from the `main` branch of
[the repository](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol), then run a
[local test network](getting_started/hello_linera.md#using-a-local-test-network).

You may also need to select specific Cargo features during compilation using
`--features`.
